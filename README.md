## Description

This project is blog post app. This app can be used to post anything tech related, from new technologies to personal accomplishments. Users can update or delete their own posts, as well as comment on others. My motive for this project was to apply my fullStack skills using the MVC paradigm, express.js, sequelize, mysql, handlebars.js, user authentication and protection. This project taught me alot about my fullstack skillset and where I need to improve.
